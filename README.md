TODOs
-----
It's under active development until it satisfy my needs. Below are something in my mind:
* geekdict list  : List all words you have searched
* geekdict remove : Remove word you know from your new words list
* Use google translate engine as alternative, as well as supporting other target language. Low priority, only focus on Chinese.
* A simple website
	- Provide own translate service to translate and save new words
	- A command line interface to do the same thing like this
	- A nice web page to show all your new words, which could be a good place to review the new words and remember them.
